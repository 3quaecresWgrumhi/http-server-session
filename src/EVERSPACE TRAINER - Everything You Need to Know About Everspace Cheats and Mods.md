A trainer is a program that modifies the game's memory and allows you to activate various cheats and hacks. With a trainer, you can have infinite health, shield, armor, weapon energy, missiles, boost, consumables, and devices. You can also set the game speed, one-hit kill enemies, edit your credit and XP, and more. A trainer can make the game easier or harder, depending on your preference.
