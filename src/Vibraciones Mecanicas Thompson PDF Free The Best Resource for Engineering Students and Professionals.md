In this section, we will give you a brief overview of the main topics covered in Vibraciones Mecanicas Thompson. The book is divided into 12 chapters, each with its own exercises and examples. The chapters are:

1. Introduction. This chapter introduces the basic concepts and terminology of mechanical vibrations, such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, mass, stiffness, damping, and energy. It also explains the difference between free and forced vibrations, and between linear and nonlinear vibrations.
2. Free Vibration of Single-Degree-of-Freedom Systems. This chapter deals with the vibration of systems that have only one degree of freedom, meaning that they can only move in one direction. It shows how to find the natural frequency and mode shape of such systems, and how to analyze their response to initial conditions or external forces.
3. Harmonically Excited Vibration. This chapter focuses on the vibration of systems that are subjected to harmonic forces, meaning that they vary sinusoidally with time. It explains how to find the steady-state and transient response of such systems, and how to use complex numbers and phasors to simplify the calculations.
4. Vibration Under General Forcing Conditions. This chapter extends the analysis of forced vibration to more general cases, such as periodic, nonperiodic, and random forces. It introduces the concepts of Fourier series, Fourier transform, convolution integral, impulse response function, and frequency response function.
5. Two-Degree-of-Freedom Systems. This chapter studies the vibration of systems that have two degrees of freedom, meaning that they can move in two directions. It shows how to find the natural frequencies and mode shapes of such systems, and how to analyze their response to initial conditions or external forces.
6. Multidegree-of-Freedom Systems. This chapter generalizes the vibration analysis to systems that have more than two degrees of freedom, meaning that they can move in more than two directions. It shows how to use matrix methods and eigenvalue problems to find the natural frequencies and mode shapes of such systems, and how to use modal analysis and modal superposition to find their response.
7. Determination of Natural Frequencies and Mode Shapes. This chapter presents some alternative methods for finding the natural frequencies and mode shapes of multidegree-of-freedom systems, such as Rayleigh's method, Dunkerley's method, Holzer's method, Stodola's method, and Jacobi's method.
8. Vibration Control. This chapter discusses some techniques for reducing or eliminating unwanted vibrations in mechanical systems, such as isolation, absorption, balancing, tuning, damping, feedback control, and active control.
9. Vibration Measurement and Applications. This chapter describes some instruments and methods for measuring vibration parameters, such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, frequency, phase angle, power spectrum, coherence function, transfer function, etc. It also gives some examples of applications of vibration analysis in engineering fields.
10. Numerical Integration Methods in Vibration Analysis. This chapter introduces some numerical methods for solving differential equations that govern the vibration of mechanical systems,
such as Euler's method, Runge-Kutta method,
Newmark's method,
Wilson's method,
and central difference method.
11. Vibration of Continuous Systems. This chapter deals with the vibration of systems that are not discrete masses connected by springs or dampers,
but rather continuous bodies,
such as strings,
rods,
beams,
plates,
and shells.
It shows how to use partial differential equations,
boundary conditions,
and separation of variables
to find the natural frequencies and mode shapes of such systems,
and how to analyze their response to initial conditions or external forces.
12. Finite Element Method. This chapter introduces the finite element method,
a powerful numerical technique for solving complex problems in vibration analysis.
It explains how to divide a continuous system into discrete elements,
how to formulate the element stiffness matrix and mass matrix,
how to assemble the global stiffness matrix and mass matrix,
how to apply boundary conditions and loads,
and how to solve for the natural frequencies and mode shapes
and the response of the system.
